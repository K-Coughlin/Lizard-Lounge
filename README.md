# Lizard-Lounge
Lizard Lounge is a project manufactured by a team of four as part of our senior design project at UMass Amherst. The goal is to create a constantly maintained environment aimed for basking reptiles such as bearded dragons. The project consists of the vivarium itself, a custom PCB and built-in peripherals, and a user web application.
